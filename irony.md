They say timing is everything... except when it's not, like in this case of me submitting this file. 

The irony? In a lecture about computational intelligence, the only computation that failed was my ability to calculate the deadline correctly. Let's call it a creative interpretation of the submission rules, or better yet, an exercise in "flexible deadlines" – clearly, deadlines are just a suggestion, right?

But here we are, irony in hand, late but surely appreciated (at least by me). Lesson learned: next time, I’ll submit ahead of time—unless, of course, my algorithm for procrastination optimization kicks in again.

**Submitted fashionably late, as all good jokes are.**
